## Welcome to FINCH

 Finch is a Domain Specific Language and code generation framework for PDEs using finite element and finite volume methods. It features a modular code generation system that can generate for a variety of targets to suit the scale and characteristics of a problem. This software is currently in development and new capabilities (and bugs) are evolving continuously.
