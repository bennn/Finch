Style Guide for Finch.

Naming:
Modules: capitalized, camelCase like "CodeGenerator"
Structs: capitalized, camelCase like "MeshData"
User interface functions: lower case, camelCase

Names should NOT be excessively shortened unless obvious from the context.
For example "distribution_coefficient" could be something like "distrib_coef"
but not "dc" or "dist".

Feel free to make any more suggestions on style.
